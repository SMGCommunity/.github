## Welcome to the SMGCommunity organization!
We are a group of modders that are dedicated to reverse engineering both games in the Super Mario Galaxy series. We have two in-progress decompilations of both games, [Petari](https://github.com/SMGCommunity/Petari) for Super Mario Galaxy 1 and  [Garigari](https://github.com/SMGCommunity/Garigari) for Super Mario Galaxy 2. We also have [Syati](https://github.com/SMGCommunity/Syati) for those who wish to modify the code of Super Mario Galaxy 2!
